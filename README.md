# How to play
The board consists of 9 TicTacToe boards. The game is played by two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces on each of the boards. The player who wins three of the boards in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The box that a player choses to place it's mark will determine the board where the next player must play. For example, if player X places its mark in the top right box of a board, player O must play in the board that corresponds to the top right box of the main board.

If a player places its mark in a board that has already been won **by their opponent**, the next player **breaks free** and can play in any board.

If a player places its mark in a board that has already been won **by them**, the next player **must play in a board of the player's choice**.
